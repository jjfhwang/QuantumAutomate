# QuantumAutomate: Orchestrating Quantum Workflows

QuantumAutomate is a Go-based framework designed to streamline the execution and management of quantum algorithms and workflows on various quantum computing platforms. It provides a unified interface for interacting with different quantum devices and simulators, allowing developers to focus on algorithm design rather than platform-specific implementation details. The framework offers robust error handling, resource management, and monitoring capabilities, ensuring efficient and reliable execution of quantum computations.

This project aims to abstract away the complexities associated with quantum hardware and software, enabling researchers and developers to rapidly prototype and deploy quantum applications. By providing a consistent and well-defined API, QuantumAutomate simplifies the integration of quantum computing into existing workflows and facilitates the exploration of novel quantum algorithms. Furthermore, the modular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to new quantum platforms and technologies as they emerge. The goal is to make quantum computing more accessible and practical for a broader range of users, fostering innovation and accelerating the development of quantum-enhanced solutions.

QuantumAutomate offers several key benefits, including reduced development time, improved code portability, and enhanced resource utilization. It provides a high-level abstraction layer that shields developers from the intricacies of quantum hardware, allowing them to focus on the core logic of their algorithms. The framework also incorporates sophisticated scheduling and optimization techniques to ensure efficient allocation of quantum resources. With comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, QuantumAutomate enables users to track the progress of their quantum computations and identify potential performance bottlenecks. By streamlining the entire quantum workflow, QuantumAutomate empowers developers to unlock the full potential of quantum computing.

## Key Features

*   **Platform Abstraction Layer:** Implements a standardized interface for interacting with various quantum computing backends, including IBM Quantum Experience, Rigetti Forest, and local simulators (e.g., Qiskit Aer, Cirq). This allows developers to switch between different platforms without modifying their code. The abstraction is achieved using Go interfaces and concrete implementations for each backend. For instance, the `QuantumBackend` interface defines methods for submitting circuits, retrieving results, and querying device properties.
*   **Workflow Definition Language:** Provides a declarative language (based on YAML) for defining complex quantum workflows, including dependencies between quantum circuits and classical computations. This allows users to specify the execution order of tasks and the data dependencies between them. The workflow engine parses the YAML definition and orchestrates the execution of the workflow, handling data transfer and error handling automatically.
*   **Resource Management:** Integrates with resource management systems (e.g., Kubernetes, Slurm) to automatically allocate and manage quantum resources. This ensures efficient utilization of available quantum devices and prevents resource contention. The resource manager uses information about the workflow requirements (e.g., number of qubits, circuit depth) to request the appropriate resources from the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Error Mitigation:** Incorporates various error mitigation techniques, such as zero-noise extrapolation and probabilistic error cancellation, to improve the accuracy of quantum computations. These techniques are applied automatically during the execution of the workflow, based on user-defined parameters. The error mitigation algorithms are implemented as pluggable modules, allowing users to easily add new techniques.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Provides comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing users to track the progress of their quantum computations and identify potential performance bottlenecks. Metrics such as circuit execution time, qubit coherence time, and error rates are collected and displayed in a real-time dashboard. Logs are stored for auditing and debugging purposes.
*   **Circuit Optimization:** Includes a circuit optimization module that automatically optimizes quantum circuits before execution. This module applies various optimization techniques, such as gate cancellation, gate fusion, and qubit mapping, to reduce the circuit depth and improve the performance of the computation. The optimization algorithms are implemented using a graph-based representation of the quantum circuit.
*   **Data Serialization and Deserialization:** Supports serialization and deserialization of quantum data formats (e.g., QASM, Quil, OpenQASM) using standard data formats (e.g., JSON, Protobuf). This allows for seamless integration with other quantum computing tools and frameworks.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The core programming language for implementing the QuantumAutomate framework. Go's concurrency features and strong typing make it well-suited for building scalable and reliable quantum computing applications.
*   **YAML:** Used for defining quantum workflows in a declarative manner. YAML's human-readable syntax makes it easy to specify complex workflows with dependencies and data dependencies.
*   **gRPC:** Used for communication between different components of the QuantumAutomate framework, such as the workflow engine, resource manager, and quantum backend adapters. gRPC provides a high-performance and efficient communication protocol.
*   **Kubernetes (Optional):** Used for deploying and managing QuantumAutomate in a containerized environment. Kubernetes provides a scalable and resilient platform for running quantum computing applications.
*   **Prometheus and Grafana (Optional):** Used for monitoring the performance of QuantumAutomate and visualizing metrics such as circuit execution time, qubit coherence time, and error rates.

## Installation

1.  **Install Go:** Ensure you have Go installed and configured on your system. You can download the latest version from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/). After installation, set the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables appropriately.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the QuantumAutomate repository from GitHub:
  `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumAutomate`
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
  `cd QuantumAutomate`
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Use the `go mod` command to download and install the required dependencies:
  `go mod tidy`
5.  **Build the Project:** Build the QuantumAutomate executable:
  `go build -o quantumautomate`

## Configuration

QuantumAutomate uses environment variables for configuration. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `QUANTUM_BACKEND`: Specifies the quantum backend to use (e.g., `ibm_quantum`, `rigetti`, `qiskit_aer`). Defaults to `qiskit_aer`.
*   `IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN`: Your IBM Quantum Experience API token (required if `QUANTUM_BACKEND` is set to `ibm_quantum`).
*   `RIGETTI_API_TOKEN`: Your Rigetti Forest API token (required if `QUANTUM_BACKEND` is set to `rigetti`).
*   `WORKFLOW_DEFINITION_PATH`: The path to the YAML file containing the workflow definition. Defaults to `workflow.yaml`.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Defaults to `info`.

You can set these environment variables using the `export` command (Linux/macOS) or the `set` command (Windows). For example:

  `export QUANTUM_BACKEND=ibm_quantum`
  `export IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN>`

## Usage

To run a quantum workflow, execute the `quantumautomate` command with the path to the workflow definition file:

  `./quantumautomate --workflow workflow.yaml`

Here's an example of a simple workflow definition file (`workflow.yaml`):

  `version: "1.0"`
  `tasks:`
  `- name: "Hadamard"`
  `type: "quantum"`
  `circuit: "qreg q[2]; h q[0]; cx q[0], q[1]; measure q[0] -> c[0]; measure q[1] -> c[1];"`
  `backend: "qiskit_aer"`
  `- name: "ClassicalProcessing"`
  `type: "classical"`
  `script: "python process_results.py"`
  `dependencies: ["Hadamard"]`

This workflow defines two tasks: a quantum task that executes a Hadamard circuit on a two-qubit register and a classical task that processes the results of the quantum computation using a Python script.

The API documentation will be available soon.
