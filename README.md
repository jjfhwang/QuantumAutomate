# QuantumAutomate: Decentralized Crypto Trading Automation

A serverless, event-driven platform for algorithmic crypto trading, leveraging verifiable computation and smart contract execution.

## Detailed Description

QuantumAutomate provides a decentralized and secure platform for automating cryptocurrency trading strategies. It addresses the limitations of centralized exchanges and traditional algorithmic trading solutions by leveraging verifiable computation and smart contracts. This ensures transparency, auditability, and reduces counterparty risk. The platform is designed around a serverless, event-driven architecture, allowing for scalability and resilience. Trading strategies are defined as modular Go programs that respond to market events and execute trades directly through smart contracts on a supported blockchain.

The core functionality revolves around three main components: event listeners, strategy execution modules, and smart contract integration. Event listeners monitor market data feeds (e.g., price changes, order book updates) from various cryptocurrency exchanges. When specific events trigger, they pass the data to the relevant strategy execution module. These modules, written in Go, implement the user-defined trading logic. Based on this logic, the module then prepares and signs a transaction to execute a trade through a pre-deployed smart contract. Verifiable computation adds an extra layer of security by allowing off-chain computation of trade logic with on-chain verification of the results, preventing manipulation and ensuring correct execution.

QuantumAutomate offers several key benefits: *Decentralization:* Eliminates the need to trust a central exchange to execute trades fairly. *Transparency:* All trades are executed through smart contracts on the blockchain, making them publicly verifiable. *Security:* Verifiable computation protects against manipulation of trading strategies. *Automation:* Allows for fully automated trading based on pre-defined algorithms. *Scalability:* Serverless architecture ensures the platform can handle high trading volumes. Furthermore, strategies are decoupled through event-driven architecture, reducing inter-dependencies and easing development.

## Key Features

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Employs a pub/sub model based on message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple event listeners from strategy execution modules. This enables independent scaling and fault tolerance. Each event listener is responsible for subscribing to a specific market data feed.

*   **Smart Contract Integration:** Provides a Go library for interacting with pre-deployed smart contracts on Ethereum (and potentially other blockchains). This library handles transaction creation, signing, and submission, abstracting away the complexities of blockchain interaction. Contracts implement secure and audited trade execution logic.

*   **Verifiable Computation (VC) Integration:** Supports integration with VC platforms (e.g., zkSNARKs, Truebit) to enable off-chain computation of complex trading strategies with on-chain verification. This ensures integrity of the computation while reducing gas costs. Proofs of computation are submitted to the smart contract alongside trade parameters.

*   **Modular Strategy Development:** Strategy execution modules are developed as independent Go packages. They can be dynamically loaded and configured at runtime, allowing for easy deployment and updates of trading strategies without restarting the entire system. Configuration is managed via YAML files.

*   **Risk Management Framework:** Includes a configurable risk management system that allows users to define limits on position size, maximum loss, and other risk parameters. These parameters are enforced by the strategy execution module and the smart contract. A risk engine monitors all active strategies and alerts the user if any limits are breached.

*   **Historical Data Backtesting:** Provides tools for backtesting trading strategies on historical market data. This allows users to evaluate the performance of their strategies before deploying them to live trading. Backtesting data can be imported from various sources (e.g., CSV files, exchange APIs).

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Integrates with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to provide real-time visibility into the platform's performance and the status of trading strategies. Alerts can be configured to notify users of important events, such as trade executions, errors, or breaches of risk limits.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The primary programming language for the event listeners, strategy execution modules, and core platform components due to its performance, concurrency features, and strong standard library.
*   **Ethereum (or other EVM-compatible blockchain):** The platform for deploying and executing smart contracts that handle trade execution.
*   **RabbitMQ/Kafka:** A message queue system used for event distribution in the event-driven architecture.
*   **gRPC:** For communication between microservices and strategy modules.
*   **Solidity:** Smart contract language for writing and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum.
*   **Docker:** For containerizing the platform components, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across environments.
*   **Kubernetes:** For orchestrating and managing the containerized components in a production environment.

## Installation

1.  **Install Go:** Download and install Go from the official Go website (https://go.dev/dl/). Set the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumAutomate.git
    cd QuantumAutomate

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    go mod download
    go mod tidy

4.  **Build the Executables:**
    go build -o eventlistener cmd/eventlistener/main.go
    go build -o strategymodule cmd/strategymodule/main.go
    go build -o riskengine cmd/riskengine/main.go

5.  **Install Docker:** Download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

6.  **Configure Docker Compose:** (Optional for local development)
    Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services (e.g., RabbitMQ, Ethereum node, event listener, strategy module).

7.  **Start the Services:** (Using Docker Compose)
    docker-compose up -d

## Configuration

The platform components are configured using environment variables and YAML configuration files.

*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   `RABBITMQ_URL`: The URL of the RabbitMQ server.
    *   `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account used to sign transactions.
    *   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed smart contract.
*   **YAML Configuration Files:**
    *   `config/eventlistener.yaml`: Configuration for the event listener, including the exchange API keys, market data feeds to subscribe to, and the address of the message queue.
    *   `config/strategymodule.yaml`: Configuration for the strategy module, including the risk management parameters, trading strategy parameters, and the address of the smart contract.
    *   `config/riskengine.yaml`: Configuration for the risk engine, including risk limits, alert thresholds, and notification settings.

Example `config/strategymodule.yaml`:


## Usage

After installation and configuration, the platform will automatically start listening for market events and executing trades based on the configured strategies.

The event listener consumes market data and publishes events to the message queue. The strategy module subscribes to these events, executes the trading logic, and submits transactions to the smart contract. The risk engine monitors the trading activity and alerts the user if any risk limits are breached.

For example, to trigger a trade manually (for testing purposes):

1.  Publish a mock market data event to the message queue using a command-line tool or a script.
2.  The strategy module will receive the event and execute the trading logic.
3.  If the conditions for a trade are met, the strategy module will submit a transaction to the smart contract.
4.  The smart contract will execute the trade and update the user's balance.
